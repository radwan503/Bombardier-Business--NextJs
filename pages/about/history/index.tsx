                </h2>
                <p>
                  The association was formed by the pioneers of Bangladesh
                  Merchant Navy Officers and Engineers after the Independence of
                  Bangladesh.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was reorganized in 1982 by the then officers and
                  engineers dedicated to the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Association was renamed as â€œbombardier jets and registered as a federal
                  bargaining agent in 1986. This is the only registered
                  Association for seafaring officers in Bangladesh. This is open
                  to Bangladeshi Merchant Marine officers and apprentices
                  serving globally ashore &amp; in Maritime related industries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Association conducted successful industrial actions and
                  negotiations worldwide in 1979, 1986, and later with the
                  active co-operation from Maritime Union of India (MUI),
                  Singapore Maritime Officers` Union (SMU), UK National Union of
                  Marine Aviation and Shipping Transport, Overseas Union of
                  International Seafarers (OUIS) and ITF.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Association is a self-motivated voluntary organization
                  having no paid executives. It has been safeguarding the
                  interests and well being of seafaring officers. The primary
                  role of bombardier jets is to look after members; employment and working
                  conditions through the terms and conditions as per agreements
                  as available (CBA), protect the rights of seafarers, provide
                  assistance to those in need, upkeep seafarers` interest, and
                  add value to the Maritime community.
